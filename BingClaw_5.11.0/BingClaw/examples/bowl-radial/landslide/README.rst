Landslide in a parabolic bowl
==============================

To create the topo file and initial landslide before running the code::

    python maketopo.py
    
After running the code, create dtopofile 

    python makedtopo.py
    
Move to the tsunami folder to run tsunami simulation generated by landslide

In this code, :math:`x` and :math:`y` are in meters (coordinate_system=1 
in `setrun.py`).
